### TITLE: Explain “growth mindset” in your own words

==A== growth mindset, is a belief that one's abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved over time through effort, learning, and perseverance. In contrast to a fixed mindset, where individuals believe their talents and intelligence are static traits, a growth mindset embraces challenges and sees failures as opportunities for growth.

Here are some key principles of a growth mindset:

- Embracing Challenges: People with a growth mindset welcome challenges and view them as a chance to learn and develop their skills. They understand that facing difficulties is essential for personal growth.

- Persistence: A growth mindset encourages persistence in the face of setbacks. Instead of giving up when faced with obstacles, individuals with a growth mindset see them as a chance to learn and improve.

- Effort and Learning: Effort is seen as the path to mastery. People with a growth mindset believe that putting in effort and seeking opportunities to learn can lead to significant improvement in their abilities.

- Feedback: Constructive feedback is valued because it provides insights for improvement. Those with a growth mindset are open to criticism and use it as a means to enhance their skills.

- Success of Others: Instead of feeling threatened by the success of others, individuals with a growth mindset are inspired and motivated by it. They see others' achievements as proof that improvement is possible through dedication and hard work.

### TITLE: Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

1. Embrace Challenges and Mistakes: When faced with a difficult task or a setback, remind yourself that challenges are opportunities for growth. Instead of shying away from them, approach them with enthusiasm. 
2. Focus on Effort and Learning: Shift your attention away from the end result and concentrate on the effort you're putting in and what you're learning along the way. 
3. Seek Feedback and Continuous Improvement: Encourage yourself to actively seek feedback from others.
